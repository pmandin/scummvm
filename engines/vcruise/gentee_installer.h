// NOTE for future implementation:
// A Gentee Installer setup executable can be deployed with a package file (pak1.pak, etc.) or the
// data can be embedded in the setup executable.  If it's deployed with the executable, then you
// must read 12 bytes from offset 1008 in the executable file.  Of that, the first 4 bytes is the
// position of the embedded ginstall.dll compressed data, the next 4 are the compressed size of
// ginstall.dll, and the next 4 are the decompressed size of ginstall.dll.
//
// From that, compute the end position of the DLL data from the DLL position + the compressed size.
// If that position is less than the end of the file, then the package is embedded in the setup
// executable starting at that location.
